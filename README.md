Open Library For Computer Networking

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

If you did not install Create React in your local device yet, please follow the instruction on this website and install Create React: WEBSITE

## Necassary Steps

In the project directory, you need to go to ludi_test folder, server folder, and client folder and run `yarn install`

This ensures that your device is ready to use Create React in your local environment.

Next, go to the server folder and run `yarn start`

This will start the server and make your local device as a host.

Then, open another terminal and do not close the previous one.

Go to the client folder and run `yarn start`

This will run the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Now you are all set to edit the project on our local device.

## Common Questions

If you are on Window and `'rm' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.`

this showed up when trying to run `yarn start`

on server. Type `npm config set script-shell bash`

in the terminal to solve the problem.

## Other Avaliable Script

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
