<h2>Prerequisite: CS162</h2>
<h2>Overview</h2>
   This is a graduate level course on computer networking. The course involves 
both a reading/lecture/discussion component and a project component. We will 
read about 50 research papers on various aspects of computer networking: LAN/WAN
technologies, congestion/flow control, traffic analysis, routing, internetworking,
multicast, security, and quality of service. Students are expected to read
papers before the class, submit a one page summary for each paper, and participate
in the discussion during the class. The class projects can be either of the
following types: design/implementation, measurement, and simulation. The
lecture will be conducted in an interactive fashion. We will lead the discussion,
but we expect everyone to participate. You will  be graded for both the paper
summaries and class discussion.

   <li> <b>Project</b> A major component of this course, both in terms of
your grade and your time, is a term project.  The goal of this project is
to investigate new research ideas and solutions. See the <a href="project.html">
project page</a> for more details.      
    <p>  </p>
   </li>
   <li> <b>Exams</b> There will be two exams: a midterm and a final exam. 
Both exams will be taken in class and are closed book. The goal of these exams
is to help you grasp the fundaments of today's networking.      
    <p>  </p>
   </li>
   <li> <b>Paper reviews</b> For each paper you read you are required to
provide a short review (one or two paragraphs). Usually, you will have to
review no more than two papers per class. The goal of these reviews is to
help you synthetise the main ideas and concepts presented in each paper.
 See <a href="review_dir.html"> directions</a> for submitting the reviews
for more details.  </li>
