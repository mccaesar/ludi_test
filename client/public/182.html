<H2>Course Objectives</H2>
The main objective of this course is to provide students with a rigorous understanding of computer networking concepts, protocols and technologies. Even though we will cover the major Internet protocols in some detail, the emphasis will be on fundamental problems, ideas and algorithms. From this perspective, the architecture and protocols of the Internet are only a ``successful case-study'' among many others that were not so fortunate. Students will have the opportunity to design their own protocols, implement and test them over real networks, solve related mathematical problems, and experiment with various network measurement and troubleshooting tools.

<H2><A NAME="hmw">Homeworks and Programming Assignments </A></H2>
Material will be due at 11:59pm on the specified date and should be submitted using Canvas. 
<UL>
<li> <b>Homeworks:</b> We will have four homeworks throughout the semester. Each homework will include some problems that are of mathematical or algorithmic nature. Additionally, each homework will include a <b>Wireshark</b> exercise that you will do using your laptop. The homeworks will <b>not</b> have the same weight grade-wise (e.g., homework-1 may have a maximum of 50 points, homework-2 may have a maximum of 150 points, etc).   
<li> <b>Programming assignments:</b> We will have two programming assignments. 
The first will be simpler and it will be done individually. It will involve some basic sockets programming in Python, Java or C (your choice). 
The second assignment will be significantly more challenging and it will be done by groups of two students (or individually, if that is what you prefer).

<b> Rough guidelines for calculation of final grade (this is only a ROUGH guideline!):</b>
<UL>
<LI> 90% or more: A 
<LI> 80-90%: B 
<LI> 70-80%: C  
<LI> 60-70%: D 
<LI> less than 60%: F 
</UL>
<p>
<b>Notes about grading</b>
<ul>
<li>I can only give out a grade of I for non-academic reasons.
<li>If you end up doing poorly in the class please don't ask for "extra work" to raise your grade. This would not be fair to other students.
<li>For those registered as P/F. A Pass requires that you earn a "C" or better and that you submit all work items and take the exam.
</ul>

<H2><A NAME="misc">Communication with the instructor and the TAs</A></H2>
<UL>
<li> For any questions about the lectures, please contact Constantine during office hours or through email. 
<li> For any questions about homeworks or programming assignments, please post a question on Piazza (no anonymous posts will be allowed).
<li> For any questions about grades, please contact the Lead TA through email.

<H2>Class Participation</H2>
To do well in this course, students must take active and regular roles in discussion and demonstrate comprehension of the reading and lecture themes.  To encourage this, there are three points allocated to class participation.
<UL>
<li> 
You can earn one point by submitting a printed recent face-photo, together with your name and major/year. You need to do so at the instructor's office (so that you know where his office is) by August 27. My hope is that I can use these photos to learn your names. 
<li>
You can earn the additional two points by submitting handwritten questions at the end of lectures. The questions can ask about something that was covered in class and for which the student needs additional clarification or can ask other questions or make comments relating to the class material. Each question must have your name and be dated.
Each submitted question with a legitimate and valid question or comment will receive one class participation point up to a maximum of 2 points. Students may continue to ask questions even if they have already earned the maximum number of points. The instructor will follow up on some of the submitted questions in subsecquent class discussions.
<li>
In addition to the above, students are encouraged to come by Instructor or TA office hours as well as ask questions and participate in discussions on piaza.
</ul>


<p>
<hr>
<H2><A NAME="policy">Course Policies</A></H2>
<ul>
<li><b>Late submission policy</b>:  
Assignments and programming assignments should be handed in on time -- by midnight the day the assignment is due. There is a 1 hour grace period for submitting assignments. There will be a 20% late penalty for material handed in 1-24 hours late and a 50% penalty for material submitted 24-48 hours late. Material that is submitted more than 48 hours late will not be accepted and will receive a ZERO grade.
<li>All work for this class is to be done individually, except the second programming assignment. That can be done by teams of two students or individually. 
<li> You are strongly urged to familiarize yourselves with the 
<A HREF="http://www.honor.gatech.edu/plugins/content/index.php?id=9">GT Student Honor Code</A> 
rules. Specifically, the following is not allowed: 
<ol>
<li> Copying, with or without modification, someone else's work when this work is 
not meant to be publicly accessible (e.g., a classmate's program or solution). 
<li> Submission of material that is wholly or substantially identical to that 
created or published by another person or persons, without adequate credit 
notations indicating authorship (plagiarism). 
</ol>
You are encouraged to discuss problems and papers with others as long as this 
does not involve copying of code or solutions. Any public material that you 
use (open-source software, help from a text, or substantial help from a 
friend, etc...) should be acknowledged explicitly in anything you submit to us. 
If you have any doubt about whether something is legal or not please do 
check with the Instructor.
